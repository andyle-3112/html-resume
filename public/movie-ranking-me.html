<p>This movie just simply one of the best horror movie of all-time. Well-built storyline, great performances from actors, beautiful cinematography, and also lots of disturbing easter eggs about... devils</p>

<h3>Call me by your name</h3>

<p>I keep coming back this movie once in a while. Can't count how many times I've watched it. Sweet and Painful and Gay</p>
